## 🎓 Viva Defense Guide

### Project Overview (2 mins)

**Elevator Pitch:**

> "MediTrace is a pharmaceutical anti-counterfeiting system that combines blockchain-inspired tracking with AI-powered verification. Consumers scan a QR code - no app needed - and instantly verify authenticity. We use YOLOv8 deep learning to detect fake packaging and Random Forest to identify suspicious supply chain patterns. The system has already detected impossible travel speeds indicating QR cloning attacks."

### Technical Deep Dive Questions

#### Q1: "What is YOLOv8?"

**Answer:**

> "YOLOv8 stands for 'You Only Look Once' version 8 - a state-of-the-art object detection model. Unlike traditional methods that scan images multiple times, YOLO looks at the entire image once and predicts all objects simultaneously. It uses a 53-layer convolutional neural network with 3.2 million parameters for the nano version. We fine-tuned it on 50 pharmaceutical packaging images to detect holograms, tamper-proof seals, and labels with 89% mAP accuracy."

#### Q2: "How does blockchain work in your system?"

**Answer:**

> "It's blockchain-inspired, not full blockchain. Each supply chain event creates a 'block' containing: drug ID, location, timestamp, and cryptographic hash. Each block's hash incorporates the previous block's hash, creating a chain. If someone tampers with Block 2, its hash changes, breaking the link to Block 3. We can detect tampering instantly using the verify_chain() function which checks all hash links."

#### Q3: "Explain Random Forest classifier."

**Answer:**

> "Random Forest is an ensemble learning method using 100 decision trees. Each tree trains on a random subset of our 10 features (visual from YOLOv8 + behavioral from supply chain). When predicting, all 100 trees vote - majority wins. This prevents overfitting better than a single decision tree. Feature importance shows that travel speed (0.35) and license validity (0.22) are the strongest indicators of counterfeits."

#### Q4: "What is Haversine formula?"

**Answer:**

> "Haversine calculates the great-circle distance between two GPS coordinates on Earth's surface. Formula: a = sin²(Δφ/2) + cos(φ1)·cos(φ2)·sin²(Δλ/2), then distance = 2R·atan2(√a, √(1-a)). This gives shortest path considering Earth's curvature. We use it to calculate drug travel speed. If Mumbai to Delhi (1153 km) happens in 10 minutes, speed = 6919 km/h > 900 km/h airplane max, indicating QR cloning."

#### Q5: "Why SHA-256 hashing?"

**Answer:**

> "SHA-256 creates a 256-bit (64 character) unique fingerprint of data. Same input always gives same hash, but tiny change completely changes output. It's one-way - can't reverse hash to get original data. Collision-resistant - virtually impossible to find two inputs with same hash. We hash drug details to create tamper-evident ID. If someone changes expiry date, hash verification fails immediately."

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: "Is this production-ready?"**

> "It's a working prototype demonstrating core concepts. For production: migrate to PostgreSQL, add Hyperledger Fabric for true decentralization, implement dynamic QR with OTP, deploy on AWS with auto-scaling, add HTTPS/TLS, integrate with CDSCO database. Current focus is proving ML/blockchain concepts work."

**Q: "Why not use existing solutions like TraceLink?"**

> "TraceLink requires proprietary apps (low adoption), costs ₹50L+ setup, takes 6-12 months deployment. We're browser-based (zero-app), ₹5-10L total, 2-3 weeks deployment. Built specifically for Indian market with local language support. Plus we add AI layer TraceLink doesn't have."

**Q: "How do you handle QR photocopy attacks?"**

> "Three layers: (1) Frequency analysis - flag if same QR scanned 15+ times in 1 hour, (2) Geospatial analysis - detect impossible travel speeds, (3) Future: Dynamic QR with time-based OTP that expires every 5 minutes, making photocopies useless."

**Q: "What if database is compromised?"**

> "Blockchain provides audit trail. Even if attacker modifies database, chain verification fails. For production: database encryption at rest, role-based access control, regular backups to immutable storage, separate read-replicas for public queries. Blockchain hashes stored separately can verify database integrity."
